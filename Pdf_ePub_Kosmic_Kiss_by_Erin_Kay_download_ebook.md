Sky Flores has just landed her dream job as a fashion stylist for a K-Pop entertainment company in Seoul, South Korea. She even gets to work with her favorite K-Pop group, KOSMIC. There&amp;#039;s just one problem-it seems like her bias can&amp;#039;t stand her. Byunho Seo has an image as the bad boy main rapper of KOSMIC. With a comeback happening and his band barely holding itself together, he has no time for distractions. So the last thing he needs is this new stylist getting under his skin. But when they must go on a road trip together to Busan, Byunho&amp;#039;s hometown, they find out they have more in common than they realize. One kiss, sparked by their undeniable attraction to each other, changes everything for both of them.
 Back in Seoul, mysterious wardrobe malfunctions start to happen on stage. Sky must figure out why and face a threat to her career and her fragile new relationship with Byunho. Return to the dazzling world of K-Pop stardom in Kosmic Kiss, the second book in the KOSMIC series. This work contains adult content and is intended for adult audiences only.
