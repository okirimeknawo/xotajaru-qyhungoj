Overview
Goodman Games is pleased to present XCC #0 Murder Mountain Smackdown, the first in its line of Xcrawl Classics adventures. DJ Hard Knoxx puts out a call for wannabe superstars from all over the Empire! Can you survive his mountain playground full of beer-drinking Yetis, angry post-cryptids, ice grommits, and an extradimensional monster seeking souls? XCC #0 Murder Mountain Smackdown is a 0-level funnel perfect for kicking off a brand new Xcrawl Classics RPG campaign and a great introduction to the unique setting of Xtreme Dungeon Crawling. PCs will be either catapulted into superstardom or perish live before an audience atop Murder Mountain.
