Overview
Craft a sales pitch that dramatically outperforms an aimless feature walkthrough. World-renowned product positioning and marketing expert April Dunford knows that standing out in a crowded market is the key to getting sales. In Sales Pitch, she shows entrepreneurs, salespeople, marketers, and business leaders how they can achieve success by building a narrative that clearly communicates how your product is different and better than anything else on the market. Using a simple step-by-step method and compelling case stories, the author of Obviously Awesome guides you through a solid sales pitch structure that helps customers make confident buying decisions, while positioning you to clearly win in the market. In this book you will learn: ‚óè Why you need to be your prospect&#039;s guide in the buying process ‚óè Why a sales pitch is a unique style of story designed to help your customer say &quot;yes&quot; with confidence ‚óè How &quot;do nothing&quot; is the most fearsome competitor you have ‚óè How and when qualification, discovery, and product demos fit into a sales pitch ‚óè How your positioning is reflected in a great sales narrative ‚óè Why your differentiated value is the star of the show ‚óè The eight components of a solid sales pitch A successful sales pitch is more than a simple product walkthrough, a canned set of discovery questions, or a pushy sales monologue. This book will help you create a winning pitch that gets you better customers-and more of them.
