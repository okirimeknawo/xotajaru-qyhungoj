Overview
Notes From Your Bookseller A sweeping survey of tragically endangered creatures, from wombats to wolves, seals to storks and beyond. Rundell explores their role in our world and our role in their collapse in this moving collection, complemented by gorgeous illustrations. A MOST ANTICIPATED BOOK FROM BOSTON GLOBE, CHICAGO TRIBUNE, AND MORE! ‚Ä¢¬†From the #1 New York Times bestselling author Katherine Rundell comes a ‚Äúrare and magical book‚Äù (Bill Bryson) reckoning with the vanishing wonders of our natural world
 

 &quot;This celebration of seahorses, lemurs, and others doubles as a wake-up call: look around and protect what you love.‚Äù ‚ÄîBoston Globe
 
 The world is more astonishing, more miraculous, and more wonderful than our wildest¬†imaginings. In this brilliant and passionately persuasive book, Katherine Rundell takes us on a globe-spanning tour of the world&#039;s most awe-inspiring animals currently facing extinction.
 
 Consider the seahorse: couples mate for life and meet each morning for a dance, pirouetting and changing colors before going their separate ways, to dance again the next day. The American wood frog survives winter by allowing itself to freeze solid, its heartbeat slowing until it stops altogether. Come spring, the heart kick-starts itself spontaneously back to life. As for the lemur, it lives in matriarchal troops led by an alpha female (it‚Äôs not unusual for female ring-tailed lemurs to slap males across the face when they become aggressive). Whenever they are cold or frightened, they group together in what‚Äôs known as a lemur ball, paws and tails intertwined, to form a furry mass as big as a bicycle wheel.
 
 But each of these extraordinary animals is endangered or holds a sub-species that is endangered. This urgent, inspiring book of essays dedicated to 23 unusual and underappreciated creatures is a clarion call insisting that we look at the world around us with new eyes‚Äîto see the magic of the animals we live among, their unknown histories and capabilities, and above all how lucky we are to tread the same ground as such vanishing treasures.
 
 Beautifully illustrated, and full of inimitable wit and intellect, Vanishing Treasures is a chance to be awestruck and lovestruck, to reckon with the beauty of the world, its fragility, and its strangeness.
