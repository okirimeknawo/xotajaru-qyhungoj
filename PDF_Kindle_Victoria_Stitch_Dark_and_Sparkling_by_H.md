Overview
The third entry in a glittering, gothic middle-grade series from the bestselling author of Isadora Moon books. Victoria Stitch will stop at nothing in her quest for power . . . It had been so long since Victoria Stitch had done anything dangerous . . . And she would need dangerous and forbidden magic for an adventure like this . . .&#039; Victoria Stitch is finally Queen of Wiskling Wood, along with her sister Celestine. She is also proud aunt to Princess Minnie Stitch-diamond baby and next in line to the throne. When old enemies resurface and kidnap Minnie, Victoria Stitch is intent on revenge. It&#039;s time for her to ride again and remind these Wisklings that Victoria Stitch is undeniable, incredible, and almost certainly unstoppable.
 
 Victoria Stitch is a glamorous, glittering, wiskling - a miniature-sized fairy-like creature -Â and the series is perfect for fans of Tim Burton, Disney&#039;s Descendants, and TheSchool for Good and Evil.
