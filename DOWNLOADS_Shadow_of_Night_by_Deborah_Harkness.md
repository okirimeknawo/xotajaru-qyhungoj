Overview
The #1 New York Times-bestselling sequel to A Discovery of Witches, book two of the All Souls Series, and now the basis for season 2 of &quot;A Discovery of Witches,&quot; coming soon to Sundance Now and Shudder.

 Picking up from A Discovery of Witches&#039; cliffhanger ending, Shadow of Night takes reluctant witch Diana Bishop and vampire geneticist Matthew Clairmont on a trip through time to Elizabethan London, where they are plunged into a world of spies, magic, and a coterie of Matthew&#039;s old friends, the School of Night. As the search for Ashmole 782â€”the lost and enchanted manuscript whose mystery first pulled Diana and Matthew into one another&#039;s orbitâ€”deepens and Diana seeks out a witch to tutor her in magic, the net of Matthew&#039;s past tightens around them. Together they find they must embark on a very different - and vastly more dangerous - journey.

 &quot;A captivating and romantic ripping yarn,&quot;** Shadow of Night confirms Deborah Harkness as a master storyteller, able to cast an &quot;addictive tale of magic, mayhem and two lovers.&quot;**
